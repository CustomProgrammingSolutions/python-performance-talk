# Optimizing Python code

# An example of correct but SLOW code

```python

import re; import array; import json; import xml; import numpy; import tensorflow;

def calculate_average(player_id):

# Performance of computers

FLOPS*






* Not the best metric of performance, but does show the order of magnitude changes that have occured in computing power.

# First some nostalgia

The first computer I used I remember getting an error when trying to run a program "Floating point co processor not installed", this was macOS 7 in the 1990's. I didn't know what a float was back then! But I do remember having to install this:

# Why do we optimize code

In a business sense we do it to make money.

When computers were less powerful you needed to write fairly highly optimized code to have any chance of it running fast enough to satisfy user requirements.

As time goes on the computing power we have available to us has increased substantially. According to Moores Law* computing power has been increasing exponentially as time goes on.

One approach I've seen was just writing slow code and letting computing power catch up.

*(it's not really a law, more just an observation and possibly a self-fulfilling one in recent years)

# Why bother writing faster code then?

Bloat and other issues have meant that despite computers being vastly more powerful some tasks are actually *SLOWER* than they used to be!

Writing faster code is not a simple tradeoff of development costs vs speed.

Writing faster code can be easier than slower code, the example code for this talk took me a LOT longer to write than doing it properly.

We have pareto optimal situations and ones that are not.

#Back to the example code

# Different implementations

There's some options that will let you get some more speed without needing to change your code*.

If you are using CPython you may be able to switch to a more performant implementation like PyPy.

CPython is slow!

*Provided that the libraries are supported by the other implementation.
